# OfferOps Landing – Premium Upgrade Plan

Reference: [Infrathrone Elite](https://elite.infrathrone.xyz/) – target “big course” feel and ~₹70k program credibility.

## Gaps vs reference

- **Urgency**: No countdown / limited-seats / batch date prominence.
- **Hero**: Headline and subtext are strong but lack pill badges and a clear “what you get” strip.
- **Typography**: Headings could be larger and more impactful; section labels could feel more premium.
- **Content depth**: No dedicated Instructor block, no FAQ, no “backed by” or partners.
- **Motion**: Existing reveal is good; add subtle polish (stagger, hover, optional countdown).
- **Visual weight**: More glass/card treatments and consistent “premium” spacing.

## Phase 1 (Implemented)

- **Hero**: Urgency badge (Limited seats · March 2026), larger display headline, pill badges (12 Mocks · Real client work · Resume that converts), metric strip refined.
- **Globals**: Stronger heading scale, section label with accent, CTA glow retained.
- **Instructor**: New section with card, tagline, optional stats.
- **FAQ**: New section with 5–6 questions from config.
- **Section labels**: Uppercase, tracking, optional accent line for consistency.

## Phase 2 (Optional)

- Countdown component (next cohort date).
- “Backed by” / partners strip if brands are available.
- Curriculum timeline (week pills) similar to reference.
- Light parallax or scroll-triggered refinements.
- Optional dark grain texture for depth.

## Phase 3 (Optional)

- Testimonials carousel or larger quote cards.
- Pricing/offer strip (“Flat X% off” style) if applicable.
- More “what you get” icons or feature grid.

## Design principles

- **Typography**: One strong display/heading font (Sora), clear hierarchy (h1 > h2 > body).
- **Color**: Keep dark theme; indigo/violet accents; high contrast for CTAs.
- **Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; use for reveal and hover, not distraction.
- **Spacing**: Generous section padding; consistent max-width and vertical rhythm.
