🔥 OfferOps: DevOps Interview War Room (30 Days)

Clean. Memorable. Strong.

⸻

🎯 Who This Is For
	•	DevOps engineers struggling to clear final rounds
	•	Engineers stuck in same salary band
	•	People getting interviews but no offers
	•	People afraid of system design / Kubernetes deep dives
	•	People with knowledge but no “production stories”
	•	Engineers switching jobs after 1–2 years

⸻

🧠 Core Philosophy

Most people fail interviews because:
	•	They know tools
	•	But can’t explain architecture
	•	Can’t talk trade-offs
	•	Can’t narrate production stories
	•	Can’t handle scenario questions
	•	CV doesn’t reflect impact

We fix ALL of that.
